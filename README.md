# Keepers - Web Application
Keepers is an award-winning application that monitors children's text messages on
all social media platforms simultaneously and protects them from the dangers of cyberbullying.

In this project we have developed the parent dashboard to help him monitor his child phone by showing statistics of his child phone usage, abusive conversations and live information - child whereabout cell percentage.
